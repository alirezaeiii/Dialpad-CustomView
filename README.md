# Dialpad-CustomView
Custom ViewGroup that lays out child views with equal distance.

## About
Same design could be handled by nesting LinearLayouts. 
However, padLayout can considerably improve that hierarchy into something more efficient.
Part of idea is taken from [CalculatorPadLayout](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Calculator/+/marshmallow-mr3-release/src/com/android/calculator2/CalculatorPadLayout.java) and [BoxGridLayout](https://github.com/devunwired/custom-view-examples/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/customview/widget/BoxGridLayout.java) open source projects. 
Other custom views can be built simply by using this Custom ViewGroup such as Dialpad. In the app module we have 4 Dialpad which use PadLayout library and the 5th one is a non-optimize solution with nesting LinearLayouts. PadLayout doesn't go through the general-purpose layout engine like ConstraintLayout, which has much more overhead to support complex constraints. ConstraintLayout parses constraints from XML and builds a graph, while PadLayout logic is direct and mathematical.
